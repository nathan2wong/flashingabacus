Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/nathan2wong/flashingabacus/FlashingAbacusInstructions.pdf">Instruction Manual</a> on how to use this application.

Need to implement:
<li>Blinking feature with time. SetTimeout()</li>
<li>More reliable division algorithm</li>
<li>Random digits for addition / subtraction</li>

If you have any suggestions or improvements you would like to make, feel free to contact me or make a pull request.
